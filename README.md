## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Vanilla JavaScript
- API integration

### What I learned

The forecast was quite challenging. I learned to use the forEach loop to copy each forecast day multiple times. I also learned how to convert Unix day to a legible format.

### Continued development

I want to refactor my code and continue working with APIs. I would like to add error handling to the API calls.
